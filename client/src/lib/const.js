Update from git repository (pull)

Run the build step (ex: pnpm build, flutter build, npm run build)

This script updates the project without manual intervention in environments such as CI/CD.

üìå Where to Use?
In simplified versions of CI/CD pipelines

Local deployments on Raspberry Pi or low-cost servers

On systems where Docker images need to be kept up to date

For build after deployment on simple staging servers

‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Consider
If there are merge conflicts during the pull operation, the script may fail.

If the build fails, subsequent operations will be affected.

If private repo is used instead of public repo, the access token should be stored securely.

The directory where the script will run must be set correctly, there is a risk of overwriting the wrong repo.`,
